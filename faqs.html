                    <h3>How often should my dog be groomed?</h3>
                    <p>The frequency of grooming depends on your dog's breed, coat type, and lifestyle. Dogs with long or curly coats often need grooming every 4-6 weeks, while short-haired breeds may only need a bath and nail trim every 8-12 weeks. Regular grooming keeps your dog healthy, comfortable, and looking great.</p>

                    <h3>How long does a grooming session take?</h3>
                    <p>A typical grooming session lasts between 2 to 3 hours, depending on the size of your dog, the condition of their coat, and the services selected. For more complex services like de-shedding or specific breed cuts, it might take longer. We always strive to provide efficient service while ensuring your dog feels comfortable and relaxed.</p>
